        This document is a non-normative reference, which provides an overview of the various ways to understand and respond to Device-Independent Events on a site or app.
        It summarizes the normative information in the each respective specification in easy-to-digest prose with illustrations.

        This specification is an
        <a href='http://dev.w3.org/html5/decision-policy/html5-2014-plan.html#extension-specs'>extension
        specification</a> to HTML.

      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Today, sites mostly respond to Device-Specific Input directly, causing several issues including difficultly understanding what a user intends, complexity in building Accessible sites, and complex localization.
        This document is meant to describe the path forward for Device-Independent Events across multiple areas so that sites can be written more simply across devices and input modalities in an Accessible and future-ready way.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Framing the Problem</h2>
        <ul><li>There are <b>many device-specific ways to do input</b> and no responsive way to handle them
        </li><li>Accessibility tools have <b>difficulty interpreting device-specific input</b>
        </li><li>Frameworks and sites may have <b>difficulty understanding what is implemented</b>, what should show up on toolbars and menus, and what needs to be polyfilled in editing scenarios
        </li></ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Definitions and Goals</h2>
        <p>Definitions:</p>
        <b>Device-Specific Input:</b> the specific ways a user interacts with a webpage, including click, type, touch, and gesture<br>
        <b>Device-Independent Input:</b> Platform/modality-agnostic input that indicates what a user is trying to do, including select, undo, insert text, and delete<br>
        <p>Goals:</p>
        <ul><li>Make it easy to implement custom behavior for a given Device-Independent Input with appropriate APIs
        </li><li>Allow overwrite of behavior for Device-Independent Input regardless of the device-specific source
        </li><li>Enumerate the available Device-Independent Inputs in a given context such that toolbars and Accessiblity tools can inform users what's available and what has occurred
        </li><li>Empower complex sites to be accessible by enabling users to understand available Device-Independent Inputs with little accessibility-specific work from the framework or site
        </li></ul>
    </section>
    <section>
        <h2>Visualizing Device-Independent Input</h2>
        Today, Device-Specific Input must be interpreted by frameworks and sites. This means they have to directly handle all current and future forms of input,
        including keyboard, mouse, touch, gestures, speech, and more. Further, they have to handle internationalization for many of these methods.
        Frameworks and sites also have trouble changing browser behavior in some cases because there are no Device-Specific Edit Events for the built-in context menu, gestures, and more.
        Accessibility tools and toolbars also have trouble understanding what is site is doing because there is not a 1:1 mapping between Device-Specific Input and expected behavior across sites, and
        sites have no clear way to articulate what behavior has occurred. The following diagram shows this visually:</br>
        <img alt="Image depicting current state described above." src="images/Intentions_Present.png"><br>
        Ideally, sites should have a more direct way of understanding what a user is trying to do.
        Additionally, Accessibility Tools and other input modalities should be able to understand what has occurred in order to provide feedback to users.
        This can be solved with Device-Independent Events, which allow a site to respond to a user's intention instead of the device-specific way they
        indicated that intention. The following diagram shows this improvement visually:<br>
        <img alt="Image depicting ideal state described above." src="images/Intentions_Goal.png"><br>

      <h2>Roadmap</h2>
      <p>The following roadmap explains what we believe is necessary to accomplish our goals.</p>
      <ol>
      <li>Gain Support<p>We have several javascript frameworks and browsers involved. If you would like to join, please see our <a href="https://github.com/w3c/editing">GitHub readme</a>.</p></li>
      <li>Frame the problem<p>We have a draft of this above.</p></li>
      <li>Determine a possible solution<p>Our current thoughts on this are around an eventing system, as described below. It will need to be refined with more detailed shape, more thorough API, and further developer input.</p></li>
      <li>Create a prototype of the solution<p>A first-draft prototype is linked below. It needs a lot more before it can be adequately tested.</p></li>
      <li>Try to solve the initial problems using the prototype<p>This is the next big step.</p></li>
      <li>Refine our solution based on this testing<p>Coming soon.</p></li>
      <li>Work with other specs like Clipboard, Selection, DOM Events, and IndieUI<p>This is an ongoing process. The goal is to ensure that Device-Independent Events share a common design pattern.</p></li>

      <h2>Device-Independent Events</h2>
        <section>
        <h3>Overview</h3>
        <p>In order to solve this problem, JavaScript needs a new level of abstraction for user input.
        Device-Independent Events are that abstraction.
        There are several types of Device-Independent Events, including text edit (beforeEdit events), Clipboard, and Selection (beforeSelectionChange events).
        Building on the concepts that already exist in Clipboard events and those that are being specified by <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/selection-api/">Selection API</a>,
        we unify the story across other Device-Independent Event types such as the beforeEdit event.
        The picture would look like this, where Device-Specific Edit Events may result in Device-Independent Events from browsers or sites, which may result in implemented behaviors from browsers or sites:
        </p><p>
            <img alt="Image depicting range of Actions, Action Events, Device-Independent Events, and default handling of those events, as described above." src="images/intention_events_concept.png">
        </p>
		</section><section>
        <h3>Selection Events</h3>
        <code>BeforeSelectionChange</code> events will allow sites to manage the selection. They are being considered for the Selection API spec.
        </section><section>
        <h3>beforeEdit Events</h3>
        These events allow user input (regardless of modality) to be managed by script.
        For instance, if a site wants to manage the way bolding text works, they can listen for a <code>beforeEdit</code> with commandType="bold",
        execute their own custom bold behavior, and <code>preventDefault()</code>.
        They no longer need to listen for control+b on English keyboards or something else in other locales or modalities.
        Any platform-specific bold toolbars or gestures just work with the <code>beforeEdit</code> handler as well.
        </section><section>
        <h3>Ways to Device-Independent Events</h3>
        <section>
        <h3>Well-known Sources</h3>
        Device-Independent Events may be fired by browsers for all well-known sources.
        For instance, control+b should fire the required <code>KeyboardEvent</code>, and if preventDefault() is not called on that event,
        it would then fire a <code>beforeEdit</code> with commandType="bold".
        Similarly, the "shake" gesture on iOS would fire a <code>beforeEdit</code> with <code>commandType="undo"</code>.
        </section><section>
        <h3>Custom Sources</h3>
        <p>
        Different sites and apps have different ways that users perform input.
        For instance, a toolbar on an email site might have formatting buttons,
        or a code editor app might have different keyboard shortcuts than a blog.
        In order to enable web developers to fire Device-Independent Events when their users interact with these controls,
        a new function called declareIntention() will cause Device-Independent Events to be fired.
        </p><p>
        For example, clicking the following button would fire a <code>beforeEdit</code> event with commandType="bold".
        If preventDefault is not called on that event then the browser would perform its default action for bold.
        <code class="highlight"><pre class="example">&lt;input type="button" onclick="function (evt) { evt.declareIntention('bold') }" value="b"&gt;</pre></code>

        </p><p>
        Further, if a keyboard shortcut should be mapped to a different Device-Independent Event for a given site or app,
        it can be overwritten like this:<br>
        <code class="highlight"><pre class="example">function handleKeydown(evt) {
    if (evt.ctrlKey && evt.key === "s") {
        evt.declareIntention('strikeThrough');
        evt.preventDefault();
    }
}</pre></code>
        Now control+s is bound to strikeThrough instead of its default.
        </p>
        </section><section>
        <h3>The <code>CommandData</code> Object</h3>
        <p>
        Some Device-Independent Events will have more information than just a <code>commandType</code>.
        In order to encapsulate this data, a new object called <code>CommandData</code> will be used,
        which has a <code>value</code> attribute.
        It can be extended for a given Device-Independent Event that needs more data than just a <code>value</code>.
        </p><p>
        A possible signature for declareIntention is:
        <code class="highlight"><pre>declareIntention (DOMString commandId, optional CommandData commandData)</pre></code>
        </p><p>
        Each Device-Independent Event type will have a new property for getting this object, <code>commandData</code>.
        </p><p>
        For example, a bold Device-Independent Event that specifies the target value of bold can be initiated like this:
        <code><pre>document.declareIntention('bold', {"value":"true"});</pre></code>
        When the associated beforeEdit event is fired, its <code>commandData</code> attribute will have <code>value="true"</code>.
        </p>
        </section>
        </section>
    </section>
    <section>
    <h2>Prototype</h2>
    <p>A prototype is available <a href="http://w3c.github.io/editing/demos/intentions-demo.html">here</a>.</p>
    </section><section>
    <h3>Example Device-Independent Events</h3>

        Here a list of some sample Device-Independent Events:<br>
        <code>BeforeEdit</code>; <code>commandType="insertText"</code>; used for typing text<br>
        <code>BeforeEdit</code>; <code>commandType="insertNewline"</code> <br>
        <code>BeforeEdit</code>; <code>commandType="format"</code><br>
        <code>BeforeSelectionChangeEvent</code>; <code>commandType="extendSelection"</code>; similar to <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Selection.extend"><code>Selection.extend()</code></a>, works with keyboard/pointer input<br>
    </section></section><section>
	<h2>Relationship to IndieUI</h2>
		<p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/indie-ui-events/">IndieUI: Events 1.0</a> is solving a similar problem.
		The abstract of that spec says "This provides an intermediate layer between device- and modality-specific user interaction events,
		and the basic user interface functionality used by web applications."
		The list of Device-Independent Events it handles is given in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/indie-ui-events/#eventslist">Event List</a> of that document.
		A great deal of effort and work has gone into that document, and it has many valuable insights.
		</p><p>
		This Device-Independent Events Explainer is solving this problem by starting with concepts that the Editor uses today, such as Selection and contentEditable.
		IndieUI appears to be starting with concepts from Accessibility.
		It is important for these two efforts to come together and solve these problems for both of these scenarios.
