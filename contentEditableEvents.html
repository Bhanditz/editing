            <dt><dfn>contentEditable=false element</dfn></dt>

            <dd>Any element that has the contentEditable attribute set to

            <dd>
                All elements that after the application of CSS are invisible,
                either due to CSS properties or because the type of element

            <dt><dfn>Legal Caret Positions</dfn></dt>

            <dd>
                <p>All positions in which the caret can be placed
                programmatically. The placement is restricted to the following
                positions. Implementations MUST be able to place the caret in
                all of the following positions:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Before or after any character in any text node.</li>

                    <li>After <a>inline elements</a> that are not text nodes.</li>

                    <li>Before <a>inline elements</a> that are not text nodes and
                    that do not have a `previousSibling`.</li>

                    <li>Inside empty <a>inline elements</a> and <a>block elements</a> that are not
                    <a>stub elements</a>.</li>

                    <li>Inside empty text nodes.</li>

                    <li>Before or after <a>block elements</a> that are also <a>stub
                    elements</a>.</li>

                    <li>In the <a>contentEditable=events editing host</a>itself, if it is
                    empty.
                    </li>
                </ol>

                <p>There are some exceptions to these rules:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Within a table, the caret can only be placed inside
                    `TH`,  `TD` and `CAPTION` elements.</li>

                    <li>The caret cannot be placed inside <a>invisible elements</a>.</li>

                    <li>The caret cannot be placed inside elements who's
                    contentEditable attribute returns `false`.</li>
                </ol>

    <section>
        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

        <p style="font-style: italic">This section is not normative</p>

        <p>The <code>events</code> state is the foundation of rich text editing
        on the web, and designed to be used only with a script-based editor
        implementation. It is not meant to be a stand-alone solution.</p>

        <p>There is no default browser behavior for user input in
        contenteditable="events". Instead, it fires Device-Independent Events
        that can be handled by scripts. Details on those events can be found in
        the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/selection-api/">Selection API</a> and
        <a href="http://w3c.github.io/editing/input-events.html">Input
        Events</a> specifications.</p>

        <p class="note">When the selections contains a
        <a>contentEditable=events editing host</a>, `execCommand` and
        `queryCommand` may not work as they do in other editable elements, or
        may even fail to execute. These methods are not interoperable nor
        guaranteed to work against `contentEditable=events`, and their uses are
        strongly discouraged.
        </p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2 id="cutting_and_pasting">Cutting and pasting</h2>

        <p>Within a <a>contentEditable=events editing host</a>, cutting and pasting is
        disabled. However, `cut` and `paste` events are still triggered.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
        <h2 id="caret_darin_and_movement">Caret drawing and movement</h2>

        <section>
            <h3 id="caret_drawing">Caret drawing</h3>

            <p>A caret is drawn in any <a>contentEditable=events editing host</a> that is
            focused, that does not hold any other selections. Under such conditions, the caret
            represents a collapsed selection.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3 id="caret_positions">Caret positions</h3>

            <p>It MUST be possible to put the caret in any of the <a>Legal
            Caret Positions</a> programatically and for the caret to be visible
            in these.</p>

            <section>
                <h3 id="initial_caret_placement">Initial caret placement</h3>

                <p>Carets are initially placed at the first possible position
                within the <a>contentEditable=events editing host</a>.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3 id="caret_movement">Caret movement</h3>

                <p>Intentions of the user to move the caret trigger `beforeInput`
                events. The default action of those events is the movement of
                the caret in the given direction, if possible. The specific
                location that the caret is moved to is out of scope for this
                specification, but later versions of this specification or
                specifications covering other contentEditable specifications may
                further specify the movement patterns of the caret.</p>
            </section>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 id="text_node_editing">Text Insertion</h2>

            <p>When the user indicates that new content should be added in the
            place where the caret is currently placed, no content is actuatlly
            added, but a `beforeInput` event is triggered with `inputType` set
            to `insertCharacter`.</p>

            <section>
                <h3 id="add_with_composition">Adding characters by means of
                composition/IME</h3>

                <p>If a caret is present, and composition of a character
                through IME is initiated, composition CAN be shown visually
                inline at the location of the caret or in a separate box. The
                DOM MUST NOT be affected by the character composition, even if
                composition is taking place inline.</p>

                <p>If the user cancels character composition before it has
                finished, the inline composition is cleared and the caret is
                returned to the state it had before composition was
                initiated.</p>

                <p>When the composition of the character(s) has finished, a
                `beforeInput` event is triggered for each generated character
                in the order they are to be added as if the character(s) had
                been entered via the keyboard.</p>

                <p class="note">One possible way of implementing inline
                composition is to make composition take place within the Shadow
                DOM, using the lowest level ancestor inline or block node as the `shadow
                root`, copying all their child nodes into the `shadow root`
                before composition begins and after composition has been
                finished or canceled, the `shadow tree` is removed. The removal
                of the `shadow tree` takes place before any possible
                `beforeInput` event.</p>

            </section>

            <section>
                <h3 id="replacing_text">Replacing text/content</h3>

                <p>When the user indicates the wish to replace part of the
                contents of a <a>contentEditable=events editing host</a>, by means
                of a browser-builtin spell checker or alike, a `beforeInput` input
                with `inputType` set to `replaceText` or `replaceContent` is
                triggered.</p>
            </section>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 id="removal">Removal of content</h2>

            <p>Content is not removed automatically through user input.
            Instead, Del/Backspace key presses, etc. trigger user `beforeInput`
            events with `inputType` set to `deleteContentForward` or
            `deleteContentBackward`.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 id="spell_checking">Spell checking</h2>

            <p>An implementation CAN provide spell check, grammar check and
            other advanced functionality that are not defined through a
            specification for any <a>contentEditable=events editing host</a>.
            These features MUST be disabled by default.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 id="context_menu">Context menu</h2>

            <p>If the implementation provides a `context menu`, this `context
            menu` SHOULD contain items for editing operations such as `paste`,
            `cut`, `copy`, `delete` and CAN contain items for spellchecking for
            any <a>contentEditable=events editing host</a>. Triggering any of `context menu`
            items MUST NOT by default cause any change to the DOM,
            `beforepaste`, `beforecut` and `beforeInput` events SHOULD be
            triggered. Menu items in a `context menu` that do not cause DOM
            changes by default SHOULD function as in any other editing
            context.</p>
