      <p>
        Editing on the Web, currently done through hacks sitting on top of <code>contentEditable</code>,
        is generally acknowledged by all practitioners as a nightmare.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of this task force is to split the work that is required into small, manageable
        chunks that can be developed as primitives useful on their own, and used together to create
        editing systems.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <p>
        The endgame for this group is to produce primitives that enable the creation of useful editing
        systems on the Web, without requiring the many ugly hacks that are in common use today.
      </p>
      <p>
        This covers multiple aspects, which include most notably:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          An API to capture selections and cursor position, certainly as an evolution of the existing
          Selection API.
        </li>
        <li>
          An event or event-like system to convey the user's intent in editing a piece of content.
          This is most likely to build atop DOM events.
        </li>
        <li>
          Integration of the above into HTML, which may happen for instance through
          <code>contentEditable=minimal</code> (but a variety of options are being considered).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Deliverables are expected to be shipped as joint publications by both groups.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Participation</h2>
      <p>
        This task force is separated from its parent Web Apps and HTML WGs for two reasons. First,
        making participation easier for people not currently involved in the standards process
        (typically, developers of editing tool libraries) who may not be amenable to signing up to
        the sort of "firehose" discussion that can be found for instance on the primary WebApps
        list. Also, since the deliverables fall under the responsibility of both groups, using a
        single discussion venue is simpler than trying to coordinate the various moving parts
        across groups.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/wiki/WorkMode#Consensus_and_Call_for_Consensus">descision policy</a> is the same as that which applies in the WebApps WG.
      </p>
      <p>
        The group will use the Consortium's <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-editing-tf/">public-editing-tf</a>
        mail list for techical discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
        This group is distinct from the <a href="http://www.w3.org/community/editing/">HTML Editing APIs Community Group]</a>, 
        the focus of which is on making
        the existing editing system full described. This group is looking for new solutions, though
        of course there is expected to be some degree of overlap.
