      <p>
        Editing on the Web, currently done through hacks sitting on top of <code>contentEditable</code>,
        is generally acknowledged by all practitioners as a nightmare.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal of this task force is:
      <p>To spec and standardize the behavior of <code>contenteditable=true</code> and existing editing APIs.
      </p>
      <p>To create a simpler alternative to <code>contentEditable=true</code>, which
        creates primitives to allow for the creation of full-featured editing systems using JavaScript.
      </p>
    </section>
    <section>
      <h2>Objectives</h2>
      <p>
        The endgame for this group is to produce specifications that enable the creation of useful editing
        systems on the Web, without requiring the many ugly hacks that are in common use today.
      </p>
      <p>
        This covers multiple aspects, which include most notably:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          An API to capture selections and cursor position, certainly as an evolution of the existing
          Selection API.
        </li>
        <li>
          An event or event-like system to convey the user's intent in editing a piece of content.
          This is most likely to build atop DOM events.
        </li>
        <li>
          Integration of the above into HTML, which may happen for instance through
          <code>contentEditable=events</code> (but a variety of options are being considered).
        </li>
        <li>
          Reusing or discarding parts of or entire pre-existing editing APIs to serve as
          primitives of editing systems.
        </li>
        <li>
          Documentation of pre-existing editing APIs.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Deliverables are expected to be shipped as joint publications by both groups.
      </p>

      <h2>Participation</h2>
      <p>
        This task force is designed to 
        make participation relatively easy for people not currently involved in the standards process
        (typically, developers of editing tool libraries) who may not be amenable to signing up to
        the sort of "firehose" discussion that can be found in, for instance, the main Web Platform
        list.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="https://github.com/w3c/WebPlatformWG/blob/gh-pages/WorkMode.md#consensus-and-call-for-consensus">decision and consensus policy</a> 
        is the same as that which applies in the entire Web Platform group.
      </p>
      <p>
        The group will use the Consortium's <a href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-editing-tf/">public-editing-tf</a>
        mail list for techical discussions.
