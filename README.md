=================

The Editing Task Force can be followed on our [mailing list](http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-editing-tf/). We track issues in [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/w3c/editing-explainer/issues) as well. See the Task Force's [charter] (http://w3c.github.io/editing-explainer/tf-charter.html) for more information about the group.

High level explainers covering the way in which we are addressing editing. Currently, there are two explainer documents:

* [W3C Editing Explainer] (http://w3c.github.io/editing-explainer/)
* [User Intentions Explainer] (http://w3c.github.io/editing-explainer/commands-explainer.html)
* [Input Events] (http://w3c.github.io/editing-explainer/input-events.html)
