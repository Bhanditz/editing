      <h2>Problem and Use Cases</h2>
        The problems solved by and use cases for this document by this document are tracked in the <a href="http://w3c.github.io/editing-explainer/">Editing Explainer</a> document.

      <h2>contenteditable="typing"</h2>
      <p><i>This section is non-normative</i></p>
      <p>
      The <code>typing</code> state is the foundation of rich text editing on the web,
      and designed to be used only with a script-based editor implementation. It is not meant to be a stand-alone solution.
      </p><p>
      Other than inserting and overwriting strings within a single text node, there is no default browser behavior for user input
      in contenteditable="typing". Intead, it fires Device-Independent Events that can be handled by script. Details on those events
      can be found in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/selection-api/">Selection API</a> and
      <a href="http://w3c.github.io/editing-explainer/input-events.html">Input Events</a> specifications.
      Input Events also contains information on default handling of text input inside a single text node.
      </p>
      <p class="note">
        When the selections contain `contentEditable=typing`, `execCommand`,
        `queryCommand` may not work as they do in other editable elements, or
        may even fail to execute. These methods are not interoperable nor
        guaranteed to work against `contentEditable=typing`, and their uses are
        strongly discouraged.
      </p>
      <section>
        <h3>Cutting and pasting</h3>
        <p>Cutting and pasting events as used in other editable elements are disabled for contenteditable=typing elements.</p>
