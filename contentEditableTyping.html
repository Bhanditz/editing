        <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

        <p style="font-style: italic">This section is not normative</p>

        <p>The <code>typing</code> state is the foundation of rich text editing
        on the web, and designed to be used only with a script-based editor
        implementation. It is not meant to be a stand-alone solution.</p>

        <p>There is no default browser behavior for user input in
        contenteditable="typing". Intead, it fires Device-Independent Events
        that can be handled by scripts. Details on those events can be found in
        the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/selection-api/">Selection API</a> and
        <a href=
        "http://w3c.github.io/editing/input-events.html">Input
        Events</a> specifications. Input Events also contains information on
        default handling of text input inside a single <a>CE Typing
        Node</a>.</p>

        <p class="note">When the selections contains a <a>CE Typing
        Container</a>, `execCommand` and `queryCommand` may not work as they do
        in other editable elements, or may even fail to execute. These methods
        are not interoperable nor guaranteed to work against
        `contentEditable=typing`, and their uses are strongly discouraged.</p>

        <h2 id="cutting_and_pasting">Cutting and pasting</h2>

        <p>Within a <a>CE Typing Container</a>, cutting and pasting is
        disabled. However, `cut` and `paste` events are still triggered.</p>

        <h2 id="caret_darin_and_movement">Caret drawing and movement</h2>

        <section>
            <h3 id="caret_drawing">Caret drawing</h3>

            <p>A caret is drawn in any <a>CE Typing Container</a> that is
            focused, that does not hold any other selections and contains at
            least one <a>CE Typing Node</a>. Under such conditions, the caret
            represents a collapsed selection.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h3 id="caret_positions">Caret positions</h3>

            <p>It MUST be possible to put the caret in any of the <a>Legal
            Caret Positions</a> programatically and for the caret to be visible
            in these.</p>

                    <dd>The caret is displayed as a line.</dd>

                    <dt><dfn>overwrite</dfn></dt>

                    <dd>
                        The caret is displayed as an overlay over the character
                        that follows it within the <a>CE Typing Node</a>. If
                        the caret is at the end of a <a>CE Typing Node</a>, so
                        that no character within the same node follows it, or
                        it is placed before or after an element or inside an
                        empty element or text node, it is displayed as a line,
                        as if it were in inline-mode.
                    </dd>
                </dl>

                <p>The caret is initially of type `insert`, but can be modified
                to be of type `overtype`. The caret of type `insert` is
                displayed as a line at the beginning of the text character node
                where it is placed. The caret of type `overtype` overlays the
                text node character where it is placed fully.</p>

                <p class="issue">We need a method to switch from one type of
                caret to the other</p>

            <section>
                <h3 id="initial_caret_placement">Initial caret placement</h3>

                <p>Carets are initially placed at the first possible position
                within the <a>CE Typing Container</a>.</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3 id="caret_movement">Caret movement</h3>

                <p>The caret is not moved by default, but `beforeInput` events
                are triggered when the user indicates an intention to move the
                caret.</p>

                <p class="issue">Moving the caret within the line is not that
                difficult to do in JavaScript. Moving it in the block direction
                (or 180 degrees in the opposite direction) is much more
                difficult. It would help a lot if the browser could expose
                something about where the caret would be if it were to go one
                line into either direction. But what could the browser expose
                that would give us that?</p>

        <section>
            <h2 id="text_node_editing">Text Node Editing</h2>

            <p>When the user indicates that new content should be added to the
            <a>CE Typing Node</a> in which the caret is currently place, no
            content is actually added, but a `beforeInput` event is triggered
            with `inputType` set to `insertCharacter` or `overwriteCharacter`,
            depending on the current mode of the caret.</p>

            <section>
                <h3 id="add_with_composition">Adding characters by means of
                composition/IME</h3>

                <p>If a caret is present, and composition of a character
                through IME is initiated, composition visually is shown inline
                at the location of the caret. The composition takes place
                within the Shadow DOM, using the node the lowest level node the
                caret is contained in as a shadow root, with no changes
                occuring at the DOM level. If the caret is inside a <a>CE
                Typing Node</a> it acts as the `shadow root`. Otherwise the
                lowest level inline or block node acts as the shadow root. When
                the composition of the character(s) has finished, a
                `beforeInput` event is triggered for each generated character
                in the order they are to be added as if the character(s) had
                been entered via the keyboard.</p>

                <p>If the caret is in <a>overwrite</a>-mode at the time the
                character composition is initiated, and the caret is not placed
                behind the last character within a <a>CE Typing Node</a>, the
                character that follows the caret is hidden during
                composition.</p>

                <p>If the user cancels character composition before it has
                finished, the inline composition is cleared and the caret is
                returned to the state it had before composition was
                initiated.</p>

                <p class="issue">Do we know if it is actually possible that
                block- inline and text nodes serve as shadow roots the way we
                imagine here?</p>
            </section>

            <section>
                <h3 id="replacing_text">Replacing text</h3>

                <p>When the user indicates the wish to replace part of the
                contents of a <a>CE Typing Node</a> by means of a
                browser-builtin spell checker or alike, a `beforeInput` input
                with `inputType` set to `replaceText` is triggered.</p>
            </section>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 id="removal">Removal of content</h2>

            <p>Content is not removed automatically through user input.
            Instead, Del/Backspace key presses, etc. trigger user `beforeInput`
            events with `inputType` set to `deleteContent`.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2 id="context_menu">Context menu</h2>

            <p>If the implementation provides a `context menu`, this `context
            menu` SHOULD contain items for editing operations such as `paste`,
            `cut`, `copy`, `delete` and CAN contain items for spellchecking for
            any <a>CE Typing Container</a>. Triggering any of `context menu`
            items MUST NOT by default cause any change to the DOM,
            `beforepaste`, `beforecut` and beforeInput events SHOULD be
            triggered. Menu items in a `context menu` that do not cause DOM
            changes by default SHOULD function as in any other editing
            context.</p>
